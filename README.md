### Food Ordering System
- This project allows you to place orders for lunch and/or drinks.

- When placing an order, you can choose dishes or desserts based on the cuisine. This means you can select a cuisine and choose a dish,
then select the different cuisine again to choose a dessert, allowing you to have a dish from one cuisine and a dessert from another.
- You have the freedom to add as many main courses, desserts, and drinks to your order as you wish.
- To make the solution more extensible, all web services have been included. This allows us to add new cuisines, main courses, desserts, and drinks using Postman or Swagger(http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/).
- I am also sharing the Postman collection within the project.
